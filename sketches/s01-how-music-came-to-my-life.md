I can keep practicing English.

Juanda left me an exercise for me to do. I have to write about my relation with music. How did I start liking music? How was that first contact with music? How did all start? how I learned about music? and how is my relation with music now days.

I remember I was like 7 or 8 years old when my sister, Jessica, is singing and try to memorize songs that sound on the radio. Also my brother Pablo brought to our house a cassette with a Silvio Rodriguez’s album called “Al final de este viaje” and we all listened to it as we lived in a small house, but we liked to do it. 

He also listened to Ricardo Arjona’s songs like “Mujeres”, “Tiempo en una botella”, and others. 

We recorded songs from the radio using old cassettes and then learned popular songs of that time. I remember myself listening and trying to learn Carlos Vives’ “La tierra del olvido”. I put small parts of the song, listened carefully and and tried to sing; then I pushed fast-backwards button and repeated the process until I could sing the whole section. I sang those songs over and over. 

One day, Pablo got an acoustic guitar and took some lessons, he didn’t use to practice at home though. When he did not took the guitar with him, the instrument was always hung to the wall packed in its soft bag case. Me and my others siblings stared at it fascinated.

We are 4 siblings at home. Pablo is the oldest, then Jessica who is my older and only sister, then it’s me and then it’s my younger brother Sebastian.

Jessica, Sebastian and me; as children did not have permission to touch the guitar as we could break it or something. But some times we took it anyway taking care of not being busted. It was amazing to have the guitar in my hands. It was heavy to lift and the wood felt smooth and cold on skin. The wooden smell was nice too.
